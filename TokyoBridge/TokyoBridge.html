        <p>Hijiribashi bridge, which crosses the Kanda River, remains crowded more than 30 years after author Ryotaro Shiba wrote about it in his book “Kaido o Yuku” (Go on the road). 
            Meiji University and Nihon University are nearby, giving the area a relaxed student town atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The bridge gets its name from the fact that it connects two holy places on the river — Yushima Seido, also known as the Mausoleum of Confucius at Yushima, and Nikolaido, 
            also known as the Holy Resurrection Cathedral. Hijiri means holy in Japanese.</p>
