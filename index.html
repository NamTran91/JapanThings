        <p>Japan is divided into 47 prefectures (都道府県), todōfuken, which rank immediately below the national government and form the country's first level of jurisdiction and administrative division.</p>

        <p>They include 43 prefectures proper (県, ken), two urban prefectures (府, fu: Osaka and Kyoto), one regional prefecture (道, dō: Hokkaidō) and one metropolis (都, to: Tokyo)</p>

        <p>Each prefecture's chief executive is a directly elected governor (知事, chiji). Ordinances and budgets are enacted by a unicameral assembly (議会, gikai) whose members are elected for four-year terms.</p>
